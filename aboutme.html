        <h2>   Hey there üëãüèΩ ,</h2>
    <p>It's nice to meet you.</p>
    <p>I'm Ranjung Yeshi Norbu, a college<br> student who's passionate about learning <br>and growing. My experience in higher<br> education has been both challenging and<br> rewarding, and I'm excited to share my <br>journey with you.</p>
    <p>I'm currently on an exciting academic<br> journey, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in<br> Software Engineering at the esteemed<br> College of Science and Technology. <br>Since I started on this path, my mission<br> has been not just to face the challenges of<br> this rapidly evolving field but to thrive in <br>the midst of them.</p>
    <p>In the future, I want to work in software engineering, with a focus on Cyber security. I'm <br>determined to make a positive impact through my work, whether it's developing apps, <br>contributing to open-source projects, or leading teams.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or delve into technical discussions, please don't<br> hesitate to get in touch with me via email at ranjungyeshi99@gmail.com. Let's embark<br> on a journey of exploration, exchange ideas about software engineering, or simply have<br> a chat about our mutual passion for technology.</p>
